# FSDI_115

This is a project that was created with Python, django, JS, SQL. Our goal was to design a ecommerce website to sell shoes and have a live auction area as well for users to upload and sell or bid to buy. We used our own CSS styling as well.
The site is functioning , you can create a user, login and logout.
Features are hidden for non logged in users verse logged in users.

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project that ws created for a full stack bootcamp class.
